what is class?
A. a class is a blue print

What is object?
A.An object is an abstract data type with the addition of polymorphism and inheritance.

What is the entry point of an application?
A.Main Method

Why main is static?
A.Main method is always static so that compiler can call it without the creation of an object or before the creation of an object of the class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A.Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.Overloading is known as compile-time polymorphism

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A.The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. The keyword static indicates that the particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to an instance of that type

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.In Java, the final keyword can be used while declaring an entity. Using the final keyword means that the value can't be modified in the future. This entity can be - but is not limited to - a variable, a class or a method.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A.The final, finally, and finalize are keywords in Java that are used in exception handling. ... The basic difference between final, finally and finalize is that the final is an access modifier, finally is the block in Exception Handling and finalize is the method of object class.

What is a constructor ?
A.A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.The technique of having two (or more) constructors in a class is known as constructor overloading. A class can have multiple constructors that differ in the number and/or type of their parameters

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.All classes have at least one constructor. If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler automatically provides a no-argument constructor, called the default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.he this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A.The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class objects.

What is JVM stand for ?
A.Java Virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
A.JVM is platform-dependent

What version of java are you using?
A. version 8

What is JAR stand for ?
A.Java Archive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.JVM is Java Virtual Machine, the JVM actually runs Java bytecode. JDK is Java Developer Kit, the JDK is what you need to compile Java source code

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A.JRE is an environment, in order to execute any Java program locally. JVM is where it's responsible for converting the Bytecode into machine specific code and makes java program write-once-run-anywhere.

What is compile time and run time?
A.Compile time is the period when the programming code is converted to the machine code. Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.

What is heap?
A.Java objects reside in an area called the heap

How java manage it's memory?
A.In Java, memory management is the process of allocation and de-allocation of objects, called Memory management. Java does memory management automatically.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes. Â· StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not.

What is Singleton class?
A.In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A.Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

when to use transient variable in java?
A.transient is a variables modifier used in serialization. At the time of serialization, if we don't want to save value of a particular variable in a file, then we use transient keyword. When JVM comes across transient keyword, it ignores original value of the variable and save default value of that variable data type.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A.the main difference between a while loop and do while loop is that while loop check condition before iteration of the loop. On the other hand, the do-while loop verifies the condition after the execution of the statements inside the loop. Furthermore, the while loop is known as the entry-controlled loop.

What is Enum?

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A.The parallel collector is also known as throughput collector, it's a generational collector similar to the serial collector. The primary difference between the serial and parallel collectors is that the parallel collector has multiple threads that are used to speed up garbage collection.

What is JIT stands for?
A.Just in Time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.No

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.The major difference between Stack memory and heap memory is that the stack is used to store the order of method execution and local variables while the heap memory stores the objects and it uses dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
